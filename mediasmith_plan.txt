goal is to make an uneven playing field fair. A group of us share Warriors tickets. The number of games each person has differs. For the playoffs, we have two pair of tickets for each game so there will be two winners each time.
 
The plan is the equivalent of ping pong balls in the hopper.
Two pairs per game.
Once the first pair is picked, that ping pong ball no longer exists and there are fewer balls in there.
e.g., if Cate is drawn, he never gets another chance.

 
Gary      18
Smith     15
Art       15
Ken        9
Steve Dinetz     9
Steve Neely      6
Jay              4
Gilbert          3
Stein            2
Cate             1
