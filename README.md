super-simple way to pick winners of warriors tickets (project for D.Smith)

Overview
--------
This lottery selection app chooses winners of tickets to the Warriors 
Playoffs. An office holds two sets of season tickets, and each 
person has a varied number of buy-ins. The application allows for 
random drawings for each potential playoff game.

I used the Flask web framework, and SQLAlchemy and Postgres for my 
database. Front end was built with html and Boostrap CSS.

Future Work
-----------
I plan to build this app out to be multi-user: users can create 
a login and populate their app with participants and number of 
participant buy-ins, as well as the number of games to draw for.
